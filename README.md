Dataset from Biomedical Informatics Laboratory  
The Smart-Insole dataset, includes data from a pair of pressure sensors insoles - 29 Participants
Moticon SCIENCE pressure sensor Insole has 16 pressure sensors and a 6 â€“ Axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor for acceleration and angular raw data.
The dataset mainly has 2 groups; Elderly people and Parkison Patients.

# First Case:
Use all data of Elderly (EL)  and Parkinson (PD) patients. In the data files Columns 18-20 are left foot acceleration and Cloumns 43-45 are right foot accelerations.
Initial case is binary classification where input signal is classified into EL or PD. So all EL get a label 0 whereas all PD get a label 1
